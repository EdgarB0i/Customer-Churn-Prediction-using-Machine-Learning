# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains code and resources for a telecom churn prediction project. The project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom dataset using machine learning algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest), hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
